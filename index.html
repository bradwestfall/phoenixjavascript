<p>
Phoenix JavaScript hosts monthly events that allows members to network and hear technology presentations. Meetings are generally held on Wednesdays and we usually have stuff from sponsors to provide to members such as pizza and a t-shirt drawing. Membership is free, I only ask that you use Meetup's RSVP system to let us know you're coming. Our goal is to provide a regular event that allows our community to come together and learn from each other. We will always try to appeal to both experienced and inexperienced developers.
