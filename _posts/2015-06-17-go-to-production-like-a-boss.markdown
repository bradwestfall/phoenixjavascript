Finally. The code is written, the tests are passing, the customers are waiting, and it's time to push your hard work into production. In this talk, learn how to go to production like a boss using the PM2 process manager and give your app the same polished runtime features you've put in your code.

At the end of this talk, you'll know how to:

- Run PM2 as a service that starts automatically with server rebootsLet PM2 monitor your app and restart it if things go wrong 
- Pass environment variables through to your app to set runtime environments 
- Send your logs to the standard /var/log folder so your sysadmins know just where to find them 
- Run your app as a restricted user for increased security 
- Set limits on your app to control runaway apps 
- Manage multiple apps on the same server

There are many ways to run your node app in production. Using PM2 makes it easy to follow tried and true Linux/Unix standards that make it easier for your sysadmins to support your app, allowing you to do what you do best: write.more.code.
