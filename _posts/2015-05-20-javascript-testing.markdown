Abstract: 

Let's dig into JavaScript testing both in Node and in the Browser. We'll look at how to get started testing with Mocha and Chai, and how to run tests both locally and as part of a CI system. We'll also briefly discuss other test harnesses, assertion libraries, and mocking frameworks such as Jasmin, Sinon, and Proxyquire. Testing gives you peace of mind and reduces risk both as you create your code and as you migrate and maintain it.
