This will the the second have of our March talk on Node.

If you are new to Node then you will learn how to create something practical and useful in Node. If you are an intermediate or advanced Node developer then you might learn some new tricks but most importantly you will learn a new way to teach and coach others in Node.

Bring along your Laptop with Node already installed (install from www.nodejs.org) if you want to code along during the presentation. This is an excellent way to learn node while following this presentation.
