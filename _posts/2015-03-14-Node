For March, Phoenix JavaScript will team up with another meetup group (The Arizona Software Community) as it has in the past, to merge our groups into one lecture. Last time we were grateful to host them, this time we will be hosted at their location at CEI.

The presentation will start with basic concepts and build on those to create a site-checking tool that everyone will find useful in their day-to-day role as a web developer.

If you are new to Node then you will learn how to create something practical and useful in Node. If you are an intermediate or advanced Node developer then you might learn some new tricks but most importantly you will learn a new way to teach and coach others in Node.


Bring along your Laptop with Node already installed (install from www.nodejs.org) if you want to code along during the presentation. This is an excellent way to learn node while following this presentation.

Contact Guy Ellis @wildfiction before or after the presentation if you have any questions.
